# Accessibility Statement for iTokyo Academy Website

**Last Updated:** [Date of Last Update - e.g., YYYY-MM-DD]

## 1. Commitment to Accessibility

iTokyo Academy is committed to ensuring digital accessibility for people with disabilities. We are continually improving the user experience for everyone and applying the relevant accessibility standards to achieve this goal. We believe that everyone has the right to access information and services provided on the internet, and we are dedicated to making our website as accessible as possible.

## 2. Conformance Status

We aim to conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA as our primary target. Where feasible, without fundamentally altering the core design or user experience, we also strive to incorporate Level AAA criteria.

Currently, the website is assessed to be **[Choose one: fully conformant / partially conformant / non-conformant - *Developer Note: This needs to be determined after full development and testing.*]** with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

**Partially conformant** means that some parts of the content do not fully conform to the accessibility standard. (If this is chosen, briefly explain which parts and why, or link to "Known Issues/Limitations").

## 3. Measures Taken to Support Accessibility

iTokyo Academy has taken the following measures to ensure accessibility of its website:

*   **Semantic HTML:** We use meaningful HTML5 elements to structure content, helping assistive technologies understand the page layout and content relationships.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Where appropriate, Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) attributes are used to enhance the accessibility of dynamic content and advanced user interface controls.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** The website is designed to be navigable using only a keyboard, ensuring that users who cannot use a mouse can still access all interactive elements and content.
*   **Color Contrast:** We have aimed to ensure sufficient color contrast between text and its background, meeting at least WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text and graphical objects/UI components). Specific attention is given to text on image backgrounds and in UI elements.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website uses responsive design techniques to adapt to different screen sizes and orientations, improving usability on various devices.
*   **Text Alternatives:** We provide descriptive alternative text for all informative images and use null alt attributes (`alt=""`) for purely decorative images.
*   **Clear Typography:** Fonts have been chosen for their legibility, and typographic scales ensure readability.
*   **Focus Indicators:** Clear visual focus indicators are provided for keyboard users.
*   **Consistent Navigation:** The website features consistent navigation mechanisms to aid predictability.
*   **Accessibility Audits:** Regular conceptual and (as development progresses) tool-based accessibility audits are planned to identify and address potential issues.
*   **Staff Training (Future Goal):** We aim to provide accessibility training for our staff involved in website content creation and maintenance.

## 4. Known Issues and Limitations

Despite our best efforts to ensure accessibility, there may be some limitations. Please contact us if you observe an issue not listed below.

Known limitations:
*   **[Limitation 1 - Example]:** User-generated content from external sources may not always meet our accessibility standards. We are working on ways to monitor and improve this.
*   **[Limitation 2 - Example]:** Some third-party embedded content (e.g., social media feeds, maps) may not be fully accessible, as control over their output is limited.
*   **[Limitation 3 - Example]:** Complex ARIA patterns for highly dynamic widgets are still under development and review for optimal implementation.
*   **[Limitation 4 - Example]:** While SVGs are used for clarity, comprehensive screen reader testing across all SVG graphics is ongoing.

(*Developer Note: This section should be updated transparently as issues are identified and addressed or if certain features inherently pose accessibility challenges.*)

These technologies are relied upon for conformance with the accessibility standards used.

## 7. Assessment Approach

*   **Self-evaluation:** Internal reviews of code and design against WCAG 2.1 AA/AAA guidelines.
*   **Conceptual Audits:** As performed during the initial design and development phases.
*   **Automated Tools (Planned):** Use of tools like WAVE, Axe, or Lighthouse for automated checks.
