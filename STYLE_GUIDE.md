## 4. Imagery Guidelines

Imagery should align with the "Serene Tech Elegance" theme, emphasizing professionalism, quality, and a calm, focused atmosphere.

*   **Photography:**
    *   **Style:** High-quality, professional, well-composed shots.
    *   **Subject Matter:**
        *   Modern Japanese cityscapes (can be slightly desaturated or have a cool tone).
        *   Clean, bright, and serene campus environments or learning spaces.
        *   Students who appear focused, engaged, and collaborative (avoid overly staged or generic stock photos).
        *   Subtle inclusion of Japanese cultural elements where appropriate, but avoid clich√©s.
    *   **Color Treatment:** Prefer natural colors, possibly with a slightly cool or desaturated filter to maintain serenity. Avoid overly vibrant or artificially brightened images.
    *   **Composition:** Strong use of negative space, clean lines, and thoughtful composition.
*   **Icons:**
    *   **Style:** Minimalist, with fine, consistent line weights. Avoid overly illustrative or chunky icons.
    *   **Color:** Can use Accent Color (`#1abc9c`) for emphasis, Secondary Color (`#7f8c8d`), or Text Color (`#34495e`) depending on context and background.
    *   **Usage:** For clarifying information, list item markers, or subtle visual cues.
*   **Background Elements & Patterns:**
    *   **Style:** If used, should be very subtle and abstract.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   Faint geometric patterns (e.g., thin lines, subtle grids, or Japanese-inspired motifs like *asanoha* or *seigaiha* if used very discreetly and abstractly).
        *   Soft, large-scale gradients using shades of the primary or secondary colors, or light neutrals.
        *   Emphasis on ample negative space is generally preferred over busy backgrounds.

### Advanced Image Optimization:

This section details best practices for optimizing image delivery, ensuring fast load times and efficient use of bandwidth.

*   **Next-Gen Formats (WebP, AVIF):**
    *   Serve images in modern formats like WebP or AVIF where supported, as they offer better compression and quality compared to older formats.
    *   Use the `<picture>` element to provide fallbacks to more widely supported formats like JPEG, PNG, or SVG for browsers that don't support the newer formats.
    *   **Example:**
        ```html
        <picture>
          <source srcset="image.avif" type="image/avif">
          <source srcset="image.webp" type="image/webp">
          <source srcset="image.jpg" type="image/jpeg">
          <img src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" loading="lazy" class="img-fluid">
        </picture>
        ```

*   **Responsive Images (`srcset` and `sizes`):**
    *   Use the `srcset` attribute to provide multiple image resolutions, allowing the browser to select the most appropriate size based on the device's pixel density and viewport. This is crucial for delivering crisp images on high-resolution displays without penalizing users on smaller screens.
    *   Use the `sizes` attribute to inform the browser about the image's display dimensions at different viewport widths. This helps the browser make more intelligent choices about which image from `srcset` to download, especially before the full CSS and page layout are known.
    *   **Example (for raster images):**
        ```html
        <img src="image-medium.jpg"
             srcset="image-small.jpg 500w, 
                     image-medium.jpg 1000w, 
                     image-large.jpg 1500w"
             sizes="(max-width: 600px) 90vw, 
                    (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 
                    33vw"
             alt="Descriptive Alt Text" loading="lazy" class="img-fluid">
        ```
        *(Note: `vw` units in `sizes` are relative to viewport width. Adjust based on actual layout.)*

*   **Lazy Loading:**
    *   Implement lazy loading for images that are not in the initial viewport (below-the-fold content). This defers the loading of these images until the user scrolls near them, improving initial page load time and saving bandwidth.
    *   **Native Lazy Loading:** Use the `loading="lazy"` attribute for simple implementation.
        ```html
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Descriptive Alt Text" loading="lazy" class="img-fluid">
        ```
    *   **JavaScript-based Libraries:** For wider browser compatibility (older browsers) or more advanced control (e.g., custom placeholders, effects), consider using JavaScript libraries like `lazysizes` or `lozad.js`. These often use a `data-src` attribute.

*   **SVG Optimization:**
    *   SVGs are excellent for logos, icons, and simple vector graphics as they are resolution-independent and often have small file sizes.
    *   Optimize SVGs by:
        *   Removing editor metadata and unnecessary comments.
        *   Minifying the SVG code (e.g., using tools like SVGO).
        *   Simplifying paths and shapes where possible without sacrificing visual quality.

*   **Compression:**
    *   Reiterate the critical importance of compressing all image types (JPEG, PNG, WebP, AVIF, SVG).
    *   Use appropriate tools (e.g., TinyPNG/TinyJPG, ImageOptim, Squoosh for raster images; SVGO for SVGs) to reduce file sizes significantly without major quality loss.
    *   Automate compression in the build process where possible.

*   **Choosing the Right Format (Summary):**
    *   **JPEG:** Best for photographs and complex images with gradients where lossy compression is acceptable.
    *   **PNG:** Use for images requiring transparency (logos, icons with alpha channels) or sharp lines where lossless compression is preferred.
    *   **SVG:** Ideal for logos, icons, and vector graphics that need to scale perfectly.
    *   **WebP:** Excellent modern alternative to JPEG and PNG, offering superior compression (both lossy and lossless) and transparency. Good browser support.
    *   **AVIF:** Newer format with even better compression than WebP, especially for high-fidelity images. Browser support is growing. Use with fallbacks.

## 5. UI Elements (General Principles)

*   **Buttons:**
    *   Primary CTAs: Use Accent Color (`#1abc9c`) background with a contrasting text color (e.g., white or very dark gray, ensure WCAG AA).
    *   Secondary Buttons: Use Secondary Color (`#7f8c8d`) or a light neutral background with Text Color or Primary Color text.
    *   Padding: Generous padding for a modern, clickable feel.
    *   Border Radius: Subtle rounded corners (e.g., 4-8px).
*   **Forms:** Clean, simple, with clear labels and sufficient spacing. Input fields should have clear focus states.
*   **Cards/Containers:** Use Light Neutral (`#ecf0f1`) or Off-White (`#fdfdfd`) with subtle borders (Secondary Color) or soft box shadows for depth if needed. Prioritize clean separation through spacing.
*   **Navigation:** Clear visual hierarchy. Active states should be distinct, possibly using the Accent Color or a bolder weight.
*   **Forms (Conceptual - if added later):**
    *   **Input Fields (text, email, textarea, select):**
        *   Background: `var(--background-color)` or a very light shade of `var(--light-neutral-color)`.
        *   Borders: Subtle, 1px solid border using `var(--secondary-color)` or a lighter version of it (e.g., `#bdc3c7`).
        *   Border Radius: Consistent with buttons (e.g., 4-6px).
        *   Padding: Sufficient internal padding for comfortable text entry (e.g., `0.5rem 0.75rem`).
        *   Typography: Use 'Source Sans Pro' at base size (`1rem`), `var(--text-color)`.
        *   Placeholder Text: Use `var(--supporting-neutral-color)`.
    *   **Labels:**
        *   Font: 'Inter' or 'Source Sans Pro'.
        *   Size: `0.875rem` or `1rem`.
        *   Weight: `500` (Medium) or `600` (Semi-Bold).
        *   Color: `var(--text-color)`.
        *   Spacing: Clear spacing above input fields.
    *   **Focus State:**
        *   Inputs should have a clear visual focus indicator. This can be achieved by:
            *   Changing border color to `var(--accent-color)`.
            *   Adding a subtle `box-shadow` using the accent color (e.g., `0 0 0 0.2rem rgba(26, 188, 156, 0.25)`).
            *   Ensuring default browser focus rings are not suppressed without providing a better alternative.
    *   **Validation States (Success/Error):**
        *   Success: Use a subtle green (e.g., a shade of `var(--accent-color)` or a dedicated success green like `#2ecc71`) for borders or icons.
        *   Error: Use a subtle red (e.g., `#e74c3c`) for borders, icons, and error messages. Error messages should be clear and placed near the relevant field.
    *   **Overall Spacing:** Maintain generous spacing between form elements, labels, and any help text to ensure clarity and reduce cognitive load.
